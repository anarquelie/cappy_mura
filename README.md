# cappy_mura
#### Coded APerture PYthon module (É”) with MURA support

cappy_mura is a python module based on cappy, which was originally created by bpops (https://github.com/bpops). The MURA part of the original cappy module is not completely finished, but it is functionable in cappy_mura.

See `examples.ipynb` for examples of use.

*Cappy is a python module that allows one to easily generate and display common coded aperture patterns. Coded apertures are a spatial encoding technique for straight-line optics, wherein traditional lensing (e.g., visible light) is not possible. Coded apertures are therefore used for hard x-ray and gamma-ray imaging for astrophysics, medical imaging, and homeland security applications.*
